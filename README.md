# Project 6: RESTful API Servers 

For this project, you will write two different webservers that provide an API to access hotel data:
-	A webserver that uses raw sockets to communicate with clients 
- A webserver that uses Jetty/servlets 

Both servers will provide a Restful API to access hotel information (general hotel info, attractions and reviews).  
You will deploy servers on the assigned virtual machine.
Requirements for each of the two servers and the API are described in the assignment pdf posted on Canvas.
